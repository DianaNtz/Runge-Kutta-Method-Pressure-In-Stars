# Runge-Kutta-Method-Pressure-In-Stars
Calculates the pressure radius relation of spherical symmetric stars. Calculates the pressure radius relation of spherical symmetric stars. 
Chose the branch TOV for a Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation solver, chose the branch Newton for a Newtonian star example with constant density 
or chose the brach Lane for a Newtonian star example with polytropic equation of state. More details will follow soon on my GitHub repository pages https://dianantz.github.io .

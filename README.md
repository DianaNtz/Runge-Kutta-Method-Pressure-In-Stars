# Runge-Kutta-Method-Pressure-In-Stars
This repositories code solves the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium for a spherical symmetric star with polytropic equation of state 
and compares it with the analytical solution for polytropic index n=1. More details will follow soon on my GitHub repository pages https://dianantz.github.io .

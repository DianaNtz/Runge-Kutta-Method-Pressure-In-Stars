# Runge-Kutta-Method-Pressure-In-Stars
Calculates the pressure radius relation of spherical symmetric stars. 
Choose the branch TOV for a Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation solver, choose the branch Newton for a Newtonian star example with constant density 
or choose the brach Lane for a Newtonian star example with polytropic equation of state. For more details see https://dianantz.github.io/Runge-Kutta-Method-Example.html.
